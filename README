A small judge system made to train students from the ENS Rennes at the Google Hash Code contest. 
The system is coded in Ocsigen: http://ocsigen.org/.

Apart from Ocsigen, the project makes use of the OCaml library Batteries. If you use nix, the default.nix file should set you up with the appropriate nix-shell. Otherwise, all the libraries should be available through Opam.

Simply run "make test.byte" to compile and run. The server is hosted on the 8080 port by default. You can access it at http://localhost:8080/

The server logic is in the file serv.eliom. The parsing and grading of solutions in the file scoring.ml
